## Overview

### My Problem

When working in a complex codebase, I need a fast way to capture and retrieve context tied to specific parts of the project.

Inline notes like ```TODO``` or ```FIXME``` are intrusive and leak internal intent into the codebase.

External note-taking tools are disconnected from the workflow and introduce unnecessary friction.

AI tools can summarize past work, but they remain bound to session-based context and are not a persistent, structured layer over the project.

### How ```den``` Solves This

```den``` is a tool for capturing and retrieving context scoped per project without breaking your flow.

- **Terminal-first access**: Run ```den recent``` to surface recent context when opening a shell session.
- **Project-scoped storage**: Context is isolated per project, determined by the nearest ```.git``` directory found by traversing upward from the current working directory.
- **Fast capture**: Bind ```den add``` to editor shortcuts (e.g. Neovim). Capture selected code as context without leaving the buffer.
- **Portable storage**: Context is stored locally and can be versioned or synced using standard tooling like ```git```.
- **CLI core**: ```den add```, ```den rm```, ```den ls```, etc. for scriptable, precise operations.
- **TUI interface**: ```den``` launches an interactive session to browse, create, and edit context.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PyPI package name is `den-python`, but the installed command is `den`. Requires **Python 3.12+**.

### pip (PyPI)

The recommended way to install `den` is using `pip` (or `pipx` for an isolated environment):

```bash
pip install den-python
```

### Arch Linux (AUR)

If you are using Arch Linux, you can install from the AUR:

```bash
yay -S den
```

### Debian

If you are using a Debian-based system, you can install den from the following apt repository:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://demonkingswarn.is-a.dev/debmon-repo/pubkey.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/debmon-repo.gpg

echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://demonkingswarn.is-a.dev/debmon-repo stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debmon-repo.list

sudo apt update

sudo apt install -y den
```

### From Source

You can always clone and install directly from the source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaghavGohil/den.git
cd den
pip install .
```
<br>

## Usage

### Interactive Dashboard (TUI)

```bash
den
```

Opens an interactive **curses-based TUI** to quickly navigate and operate on your notes. 

### Recent Activity

```bash
den recent
```

Fetches the most recent notes globally across all your projects. Hook this to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` to get a workflow summary when you open a terminal.

### List notes

```bash
den ls
```

Displays all saved notes for the current project.

### Add a note

```bash
den add <note text>
```

You can pass multiple words without quotes:
```bash
den add build a realtime terrain engine
```

**Attach a code reference:**
If your thought is linked to a specific implementation, you can track it with the `--ref` flag:
```bash
den add fix this rendering issue --ref src/engine.py:42-50
```

### Edit a note

```bash
den edit [id]
```

Opens the note in your default `$EDITOR`. If no `id` is provided, edits the most recently added note (default: 1).

### Remove a note

```bash
den rm [id]
```

Deletes a note. If no `id` is provided, removes the most recently added note (default: 1).
